        <h3>Preface</h3>
        <p>Nextdoor is a private social network that seeks to build stronger and safer neighborhood communities. Nextdoor currently has functionality for events, but has received interest from local speakers to give talks at community members’ homes.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Overview Section -->
      <section>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p><strong>Challenge</strong>: Community members want to connect with their neighbors and people with similar interests, but don’t have a safe or easy way of doing so. Nextdoor has a list of speakers that want to give talks, but doesn’t have a direct way to bring guests and speakers together.</p>
        <p><strong>Solution</strong>: Create a safe and inviting platform for community members to host and attend community events at peoples’ homes featuring local speakers.</p>
        <p><strong>Platform</strong>: iOS</p>
        <p><strong>Time</strong>: 2 weeks</p>
        <p><strong>Team</strong>: 4 members</p>

      <!-- Empathy Mapping Section -->
      <section>
        <h3>Empathy Mapping</h3>
        <p>Before we did user research, we talked with Nextdoor to find out more about its perception of its core users. We put our findings into an empathy map to visualize trends and begin to form testable hypotheses.</p>
        <em>(Nextdoor assumed that its core users were hosts, speakers and guests.)</em>
        <img src="../img/case_studies/nextdoor/empathy_map.png" alt="Project Empathy Map" class="image">
        <p>From the empathy map, we came up with these main hypotheses:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>People want the opportunity to get more involved in their communities</li>
          <li>There will be more people willing to be guests than hosts or speakers</li>
          <li>Socializing will be a large motivation for people to attend</li>
          <li>Guests will be concerned most about the topic presented, hosts will be concerned most about privacy and safety, and speakers will be concerned most about compensation</li>
        </ol>
      </section>

      <!-- User Research Section -->
      <section>
        <h3>User Research</h3>
        <p>With our hypotheses formed, we reached out to current and potential Nextdoor users to get the users’ points of view.</p>
        <p>We sent out online surveys to our current Nextdoor networks as well as other contacts we thought might have insights, and went out to various community centers in San Francisco to get in-field research.</p>
        <p>Here are some of the main questions we asked:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Who do you want to connect with in your community?</li>
          <li>Why would you want to go to events in your community?</li>
          <li>How interested would you be in attending a talk in a community member’s home, hosting a talk in your room, or giving a talk?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We ended up receiving 60 responses on the survey and talked to 8 people in-person. The survey results gave us great quantitative information while the in-person interviews gave us more context and qualitative depth into users’ core pain points and needs.</p>
        <img src="../img/case_studies/nextdoor/usability_results.png" alt="Usability Results Graph" class="image">
        <p>The results showed that while only 50% of respondents were actively involved in their community, 83% were interested in attending events to get more involved. This validates the demand for more community involvement through events.</p>
        <p>57% of users reported accessing Nextdoor through their mobile app (41% iOS, 16% Android).</p>
        <p>While people were most interested in being guests, which was our initial hypothesis, we were surprised that so many people were willing to be speakers or hosts. This helped solidify them as distinct user types to design for.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Personas Section -->
      <section>
        <h3>Personas</h3>
        <p>From the research, I worked with my team to develop three personas, which personify the generalized users, so that we can relate to and empathize towards throughout the design process.</p>
        <img src="../img/case_studies/nextdoor/persona_1.png" alt="Persona of Malvin (Guest)" class="image">
        <img src="../img/case_studies/nextdoor/persona_2.png" alt="Persona of Mary (Speaker)" class="image">
        <img src="../img/case_studies/nextdoor/persona_3.png" alt="Persona of Judy (Host)" class="image">
        <p>Judy, Malvin and Mary have five common needs:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>feel <strong>safe and secure</strong> while participating in events</li>
          <li>easily <strong>discover events</strong> they want to participate in</li>
          <li>know <strong>logistical information</strong> in advance</li>
          <li>learn information about <strong>who is attending</strong></li>
          <li>find <strong>detailed information</strong> about the event and topic</li>
        </ol>
        <p>For the scope of the project, we identified Malvin, the guest, as the primary persona since the majority of users said they would prefer to be guests. We also made the assumption that hosts and speakers would be willing to be guests as well, but guests wouldn’t necessarily want to be hosts or speakers.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Competitive Analysis Section -->
      <section>
        <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
        <p>Speaker Series’ main competition is event management sites where users can participate in posted events. Based on Judy, Malvin and Mary’s key needs, I did a competitive analysis to see how the competition meets their needs.</p>
        <img src="../img/case_studies/nextdoor/competitive_analysis.png" alt="Nextdoor Competitive Analysis" class="image">
        <p>Speaker Series has the opportunity to improve on the competition by:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Detailing amenities and accommodations</li>
          <li>Providing neighborhood-specific information, including safety and parking</li>
          <li>Showing users which of their friends or close-proximity neighbors are going</li>
        </ol>
      </section>

      <!-- Feature Prioritization Section -->
      <section>
        <h3>Feature Prioritization</h3>
        <p>With the large amount of features and functionality my team and I brainstormed, it was hard to tell the tradeoffs of positively impacting the users the most vs. being cost-efficient to design and engineer.</p>
        <p>We felt that the best way to tackle this problem would be through a feature prioritization matrix, which would give us a roadmap to move forward.</p>
        <img src="../img/case_studies/nextdoor/feature_prioritization.png" alt="Project Feature Prioritization" class="image">
        <p>By breaking down the features into MVP and Post-MVP scope, we were able to dive deeper into the most impactful features for the users given our limited timeline.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- User Flows Section -->
      <section>
        <h3>User Flow</h3>
        <p>Given the scope of the project, we decided to focus on designing a solution for Malvin, the guest, our primary user.</p>
        <p>I created user flows for Malvin to see how he would optimally view and attend speaking engagements, and to see how the new platform would fit within the existing site.</p>
        <img src="../img/case_studies/nextdoor/user_flow.png" alt="Malvin's User Flow" class="image">
        <p>His happy path occurs when he is invited to attend a speaking engagement. This is under two assumptions:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>The invitation will likely make him feel included which will make him feel more comfortable attending</li>
          <li>People usually invite other people they already know, so Malvin will likely know the person that invited him, which solves one of his core needs</li>
        </ol>
      </section>

      <!-- Wireframes Section -->
      <section>
        <h3>Wireframes</h3>
        <p>The majority of users reported using the Nextdoor mobile app on iOS so we designed the solution for this platform.</p>
        <p>I started with pen and paper sketches to rapidly ideate different solutions without spending a lot of time on one solution that might not be what the users really need.</p>
        <img src="../img/case_studies/nextdoor/wireframe.jpg" alt="Initial Wireframe" class="image">
        <p>This agile approach let me do usability testing early on to more fully address the users’ pain points and needs.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Usability Testing Section -->
      <section>
        <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
        <p>Users had some feedback on the main page:</p>
        <q>I like how easy it is to scroll through the top categories to find events I’m interested in.</q>
        <q>The large images make me want to find out more details.</q>
        <q>The date and time is great information to know, but I also wonder how many people are going.</q>
        <p>Though users found the top categories useful since it met a core need of event discovery, I realized that this feature was not in the scope of the MVP. Because of this, I took it out in the next iteration to re-focus on the MVP scope.</p>
        <p>Bringing the wireframes into Sketch allowed users to get a much accurate and detailed representation of how they would actually use the platform.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Prototype Section -->
      <section>
        <h3>Prototype</h3>
        <p>To get a good sense of how users would use the platform on an interaction level, I brought the wireframes into InVision.</p>
        <p>I chose to create a prototype at this level of fidelity to really hone in on micro-interaction and content details that hadn’t been addressed in previous rounds of usability testing.</p>

      <!-- Next Steps Section -->
      <section>
        <h3>Next Steps</h3>
        <p>The next steps for the Nextdoor Speaker Series platform include:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Further usability testing on the prototype to refine the MVP</li>
          <li>Depending on the design and engineering teams’ bandwidth and how well the MVP affected the company KPI’s, begin building out the post-MVP features to address the secondary user types</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Overall, the Speaker Series platform helps users discover events they are interested in and that will bring them together as a community. This builds on Nextdoor’s mission of building stronger and safer neighborhoods.</p>
